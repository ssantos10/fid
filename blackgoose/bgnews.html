In <i>sous vide</i> cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature     you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching.</q></p>
  <p>Next month, we will be serving <b><i>Sous Vide</i> Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</b>. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before <time datetime="20161130">November 30</time>.</p><p>Location:</br> Baker's Corner, Seekonk, MA</p><p>Hours:</br> Tuesday to Saturday, 11am to 11pm</p></body><footer>  <p><small>All content copyright 2017, Black Goose Bistro and Jennifer Robbins</small></p></footer></html>
